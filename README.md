# Deep Learning Camera Pose Estimation

Camera Pose Estimation originally based on Kalman Filter, using Deep Learning and recurrent neural networks.

Based on the work of [Jason Rambach](https://av.dfki.de/members/rambach/).

## Technologies

This software is based on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) Deep Learning Framework.
